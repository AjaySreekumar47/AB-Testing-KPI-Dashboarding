# AB-Testing-KPI-Dashboarding

This project demonstrates a full end-to-end workflow for simulating, analyzing, and visualizing the impact of a product feature rollout using A/B testing and KPI dashboarding techniques. The feature studied is a simulated **in-app notification**, and the goal is to evaluate its effect on user behavior and business outcomes.

The project covers:

- ðŸ“ˆ **Data Simulation**: Synthetic generation of 5,000 users and 30 days of session data, randomized into control and variant groups
- ðŸ§ª **A/B Testing Framework**: Rigorous statistical testing (t-tests, z-tests) on engagement and conversion metrics
- ðŸ“Š **KPI Aggregation**: Definition and daily tracking of key performance indicators (CTR, conversion rate, session length)
- ðŸ“‰ **Exploratory Visualizations**: Time trends and cohort-based analysis by device, region, and age group
- ðŸ“Š **Power BI Dashboard**: Clean, single-page interactive dashboard for stakeholders, exported as PDF

This repository is ideal for:
- Data scientists showcasing experimentation design
- Analysts practicing KPI evaluation and dashboard building
- BI engineers looking to integrate statistical thinking with reporting

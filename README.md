# AB-Testing-KPI-Dashboarding
This project demonstrates a full end-to-end workflow for simulating, analyzing, and visualizing the impact of a product feature rollout using A/B testing and KPI dashboarding techniques. The feature studied is a simulated **in-app notification**, and the goal is to evaluate its effect on user behavior and business outcomes.
